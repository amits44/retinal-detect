# LuminaPath - AI-Powered Retinal Disease Detection

**LuminaPath** is an AI-powered retinal disease detection system that helps medical practitioners detect and analyze retinal conditions from OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) scans. The system provides automated predictions, confidence scores, and detailed explanations, all presented in professional PDF reports.

## Features

- **Retinal Scan Upload:** Drag & drop OCT images (jpg, jpeg, png)  
- **AI Prediction:** Detects retinal diseases like Diabetic Retinopathy with confidence score  
- **Multi-language Explanations:** Supports English, Hindi, Hinglish, Bhojpuri, Spanish, French, Chinese  
- **PDF Report Generation:** Includes
  - Patient information  
  - Uploaded retinal scan  
  - AI Prediction & Confidence  
  - Horizontal Confidence Bar  
  - AI Explanation (text-wrapped)  
  - Doctor’s Signature Placeholder  
- **Interactive Streamlit UI** with modern neumorphic design  
- **Auto-prediction** when generating PDF if not already run
